# HonoursProject

This is the repository for the scripts and analysis used in my Undergraduate Honors project for the Univeristy of Edinburgh. The project involves using *Arabidopsis thaliana* genome sequences from the Southern Sweden population to find evidence of soft sweeps using H1, H12 and H2/H1 statistics developed by Garud *et al.,* 2015.

The project is supervised by Matthew Hartfield
